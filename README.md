# hello-world
my first repository

I learn very fast, and I am motivated, goal-oriented, punctual, get-the-job-done, collaboration-driven, an OK guy. 
I really, really dislike drama!
I'm a high school physics teacher, unemployed (high country-wide unemployment rate). I've always wanted to work in the IT industry (coder, game developer, design, anything). 
I was a private math and physics tutor (elementary, high school and college level).
I have elementary knowledge in HTML. I am currently learning Java, Git, SQL, CSS, Ruby on Rails; Spring is on my to-learn list, too. I have great ideas for apps, so i will learn Android Studio and Unity 3D.
I completely set up a WordPress website and run it for 6 months in an effort to get paid for placeing ads. I paid for hosting, domain, chose the skin, plugins, widgets) and wrote content (fun, science, blogs (economy, politics), op-eds...). In my country (Republic of Macedonia), all the web-site commercials were placed through marketing agencies that gave commercials anyway they wanted, nomatter the website; crony capitalism at its peak. Adsense doesn't work on sites with macedonian language, so there was no normal (clics, impressions) way to monetize the site. I abandoned the site, even though its peak performance was not bad: 99 people on the site simultaniously.
I was the president of the Judo Federation of Macedonia.
I translated five books from English to Macedonian.
I am a baker (with a licence).
I owned a sandwich shop in my dieing home town and closed it due to a lot of reasons (7000 inhabitance, low prices, too much competition, couldn't find a worker, i got worn out from a lot of work and low profits, like with the web-site i had closed previously).
